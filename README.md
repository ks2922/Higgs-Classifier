# Higgs_Classifier
Optimising Higgs Signal Search Using Machine Learning Developed machine-learning models to separate Higgs boson signals from Z boson background events. Used model outputs to define optimal binning for binned likelihood fits, evaluating performance to achieve the most precise signal rate estimates.
